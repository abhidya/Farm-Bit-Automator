# How it works

The bot is coded in python, it replicates requests sent from the client to the server. Those requests were captured using a packet analyzer on a android phone and on a virtual system running android os. By modifying the requests values, the bot is able to purchase water, hay and grain resources while also collecting produce from the cows, sheeps and chickens. The bot works to buy more livestock when the current ones expire. Using a glitch in the system, the bot will spam the buy requests allowing you to hold twice as many livestock animals. The bot also is able to purchase additional ingredients and combine them to make produce to sell. Once a set coin threshold is reached, the bot liquidates coin for bits. the bits can then be exchanged for crypto currency.
